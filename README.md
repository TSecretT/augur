  ⏳ **Current Phase**| Parsing and preparing database
  📝**Total Matches Parsed** | ~5000
  🧭 **Parsing speed** | 1.7 s/match
 
 ### Features:
 * ***Python based project:*** every line of code is pure python.
 * ***Beginner friendly***: the logic behind this project is stupid simple. 
 * ***Mongo database***: flexible database lets us work with huge amount of data
 * ***Scalable***: due to it being DNN based, the model can be used on matches from other platforms.
 
 ### ToDo List:
 - [x] Match parsing
 - [x] Match sorting for future use
 - [x] Database communication
 - [ ] Multiprocessing
 - [ ] Parsing several hubs at once
